Trump, rules that Trump's tariffs are legal, then the market resolves to Yes.\n\nThe Payout Criterion for the Contract encompasses the Expiration Values that the Supreme Court of the United States has issued a decision that reverses, vacates, or otherwise overturns the Federal Circuit's August 29, 2025 decision affirming the Court of International Trade's holding that the tariffs imposed by Executive Orders 14193, 14194, 14195, 14257, and 14266 exceeded the President's authority under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, after Issuance and before the target date. For purposes of this Contract, the government prevails if the Supreme Court reverses or vacates the Federal Circuit's decision on the merits regarding the legality of the tariffs under IEEPA, regardless of whether the case is remanded for further proceedings on other issues such as remedy or scope of relief. The government does not prevail if the Supreme Court affirms the Federal Circuit's decision that the tariffs are unauthorized by IEEPA, even if the Court modifies or vacates portions of the judgment relating to remedy or injunctive relief.

However, candidates who have merely been nominated for a cabinet position (e.g. Mike Waltz) will not be considered to have left, even if their nomination is rejected or withdrawn. \n\nThe primary resolution source will be official information from the Trump administration, however a consensus of credible reopening may also be used.\n"
